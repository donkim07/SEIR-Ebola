# SEIR-Ebola
This model extends the classic SEIR model incorporating a vaccinated compartment and considers both natural and disease-induced deaths.
VLSI Model CompartmentsV (Vaccinated): Individuals who have been vaccinated.S (Susceptible): Individuals who are susceptible to the infection.L (Latent): Individuals who are exposed but not yet infectious.I (Infectious): Individuals who are currently infectious.R (Recovered): Individuals who have recovered and are immune.Flows Between Compartments(\Lambda): The rate of entry into the susceptible population (birth rate or immigration).(a): The rate at which vaccinated individuals lose immunity and become susceptible.(b): The rate at which susceptible individuals are vaccinated.(\beta I): The rate at which susceptible individuals become exposed (latent) due to contact with infectious individuals.(\sigma): The rate at which latent individuals become infectious.(\gamma): The recovery rate from the infectious compartment.(\mu): The natural death rate or departure from each compartment.(\delta): The disease-induced death rate from the infectious compartment.Equations for the VLSI ModelVaccinated (V): [ \frac{dV}{dt} = bS - aV - \mu V ]Susceptible (S): [ \frac{dS}{dt} = \Lambda - \beta SI - bS + aV - \mu S ]Latent (L): [ \frac{dL}{dt} = \beta SI - \sigma L - \mu L ]Infectious (I): [ \frac{dI}{dt} = \sigma L - \gamma I - \delta I - \mu I ]Recovered (R): [ \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \mu R ]Explanation of Units(\Lambda), (a), (b), (\beta), (\sigma), (\gamma), (\mu), and (\delta) are rates, usually expressed in units of individuals per unit time (e.g., per day).The compartments (V), (S), (L), (I), and (R) represent the number of individuals in each state, typically unitless or counted as individuals.This model extends the classic SEIR model by incorporating a vaccinated compartment and considers both natural and disease-induced deaths.
